                Reflecting on the decades of my academic journey in the first half of my life, 
                I have never been so diligent. In these six months since returning to university, 
                I have gone from a computer science student with zero foundation to being able to 
                independently develop simple software. There have been many challenges, including 
                long hours of study, self-discipline, perseverance, and resilience. I have now completed three projects, 
                and the fourth is underway. My story continues.
